zapier ”replacement” for google sheets 

Imagine you have a digital calendar (like the one on your phone or computer) where you mark your appointments, meetings, and events. Let’s call this the “Event Calendar.”

Now, imagine you also have a digital spreadsheet (like an Excel file) where you can fill in rows and columns with information. Let’s call this the “Event Sheet.”

This script does the following:

	1.	Update Calendar Events:
	•	First, it looks at your “Event Calendar” and checks what events you have planned for the next week.
	•	Then, it goes to your “Event Sheet” and clears out any old information.
	•	After clearing, it writes the name, start time, and end time of each of the events from the “Event Calendar” into the “Event Sheet.” So, by the end of this process, you’ll have a list of your next week’s events in the “Event Sheet.”
	2.	Setting Up a Daily Reminder:
	•	This script also has a way to set itself up to run automatically. It sets up a “reminder” to run the update every day at midnight. So, every night while you’re likely asleep, it will refresh the “Event Sheet” with the next week’s events from your “Event Calendar.”

In simple terms, this script helps to take your upcoming week’s events from your digital calendar and neatly list them out in a digital spreadsheet. It also ensures that this list is refreshed every night to stay up-to-date.
